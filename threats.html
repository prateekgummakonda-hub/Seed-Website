  <h1 class="page-title">Threats to Seed Diversity</h1>
  <p class="page-subtitle">
    Several human activities are reducing the number of traditional seed varieties
    that still exist.
  </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Monoculture and uniform crops</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Large-scale farming often uses only a few high-yield varieties over big areas.
        This can replace local seeds and reduce overall diversity in fields and markets.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Climate change</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Extreme heat, floods, irregular rains and storms can wipe out sensitive local
        varieties before they are safely conserved in seed banks or farms.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Loss of traditional knowledge</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        When farmers stop saving their own seeds, or when younger generations move away
        from agriculture, knowledge about local varieties and their uses can disappear.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Pollution and soil degradation</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Poor soil health, chemical pollution, erosion and overuse of fertilisers all
        affect seed quality and plant survival, making it harder for diverse varieties
        to grow well.
