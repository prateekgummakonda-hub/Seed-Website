  <h1 class="page-title">⚠️ Threats to Seed Diversity</h1>
  <p class="page-subtitle">
    Several human activities are reducing the number of traditional seed varieties
    that still exist.
  </p>

  <div class="info-callout">
    <strong>Why this matters:</strong>
    <p>
      When many varieties disappear, our food system becomes more uniform and more fragile.
      It is harder to adapt to new pests, diseases or climate shocks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>🔥 Monoculture and uniform crops</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Large-scale farming often uses only a few high-yield varieties over big areas.
        This can replace local seeds and reduce overall diversity in fields and markets.
        Uniform fields are also more vulnerable to pests and diseases.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>🌪 Climate change</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Extreme heat, floods, irregular rains and storms can wipe out sensitive local
        varieties before they are safely conserved. Sudden shifts in climate can make
        long-adapted varieties difficult to grow in their original regions.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>🧠 Loss of traditional knowledge</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        When farmers stop saving their own seeds or younger generations move away from
        farming, knowledge about local varieties and their uses can disappear.
        Without this knowledge it becomes harder to keep and share diverse seeds.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>🏭 Pollution and soil degradation</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Poor soil health, chemical pollution and erosion all affect seed quality
        and plant survival. Degraded soils favour only a few hardy varieties and
        can push more sensitive traditional crops out of production.

    <h2>🔗 Connecting to solutions</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The good news is that many of these threats can be reduced through better
        management, fair policies and community action. The
        <strong>How we can help</strong> page shares practical steps for students,
        schools and communities.
