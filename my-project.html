          <h3>1. Research</h3>
          <p>
            I researched the basic concepts of seed diversity, biodiversity and
            food security. I collected definitions, examples and diagrams from
            textbooks and reliable websites.

          <h3>2. Local examples</h3>
          <p>
            I looked for examples of crops and seeds that are common in my region
            and tried to find out if there are different varieties used by
            farmers or families.

        <article class="card">
          <h3>3. Website creation</h3>
          <p>
            I created this website to present my findings in a clear structure:
            what seed diversity is, why it matters, threats and actions.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="card">
          <h3>4. Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            I reflected on how seed diversity connects to climate change, culture
            and future careers in science, agriculture or environmental studies.
