    This page explains the goal of my project, how I designed the website and tools,
    and what I learned about both science and coding.

    <h2>🎯 Project aim</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        My aim was to create a clear, student-friendly website that explains seed diversity
        and shows why it is important for food security, climate resilience and culture.
        I also wanted to build simple interactive tools that make the topic feel real:
        a seed gallery with filters, a compare tool and a store locator prototype.

    <h2>🧩 Design choices</h2>
    <div class="grid-2">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Layout & navigation</h3>
        <p>
          I used a single navigation bar at the top of every page so visitors always know
          where they are. The pages follow a logical order: first definitions, then why it
          matters, then threats, actions and finally my project work and tools.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Colours & icons</h3>
        <p>
          I chose green tones and simple icons to connect the website to plants and farming
          without making it visually noisy. Cards and spacing keep the text easy to scan.

    <h2>🧪 Interactive tools</h2>
    <div class="grid-2">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Seed tools page</h3>
        <p>
          I designed the seed tools page to act like a mini "lab" where users can explore
          different seeds. They can filter by type, climate and colour, compare two seeds
          side by side and try a simple colour-based image analyser prototype.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Store locator prototype</h3>
        <p>
          The store locator uses an interactive map focused on the Hyderabad region.
          It is a prototype that could be expanded to more regions in the future.
          The goal is to show that seed diversity is also about real places and people,
          not just theory.

    <h2>🔍 What I learned</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Science:</strong> I understood how losing local varieties makes our food
          system more fragile and how traditional crops can help farmers face climate change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coding:</strong> I learned how to structure pages with HTML, style them
          with CSS, host them using GitHub Pages and add interactivity with JavaScript and
          libraries like Leaflet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Project skills:</strong> I practised planning, testing, debugging and
          improving the design based on how real users might interact with the site.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>➡️ Possible next steps</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        If I had more time, I would like to add more real seed varieties from different
        parts of India, connect the map to real seed banks and translate all pages into
        several languages so that more people can use the website.
