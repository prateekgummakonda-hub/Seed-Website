    Everyone can play a role in protecting seeds: students, schools, farmers,
    local communities and consumers.

    <p>
      You do not need to change everything at once. Even one new activity in your
      school or home can help keep local seeds and knowledge alive.

    <h2>🏠 Everyday choices</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Choose foods made from traditional grains and pulses (for example
          millets, red rice or local pulses) when possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support local farmers’ markets and small shops that sell diverse crops,
          not only highly processed packaged foods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Talk with family members about the seeds and recipes they remember
          from their childhood. Recording these stories helps keep knowledge alive.

    <h2>💻 Using this website</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The <strong>Seed tools</strong> page can be used in class to discuss which
        seeds match different climates, and how diversity gives farmers more options.
        The <strong>Store locator</strong> prototype can help students think about
        where seeds are actually available in real cities and villages.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also use the information on these pages as a starting point
        for debates, essays or further research projects.
