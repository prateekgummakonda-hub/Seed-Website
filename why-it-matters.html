    <h1 class="page-title">Why Does Seed Diversity Matter?</h1>
    <p class="page-subtitle">
      Seed diversity is like a safety net for our food system, our climate and our cultures.

      <h2>Food security</h2>

          <h3>Avoiding total crop failure</h3>
          <p>
            If farmers only plant one variety and it is attacked by a new disease or pest,
            the entire harvest can be lost. With many varieties, at least some will survive
            and still produce food.

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Stable food supply</h3>
          <p>
            Different varieties are adapted to different conditions (wet, dry, hot, cold).
            This means that in changing weather, farmers can still harvest something.

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Climate resilience</h2>
      <p>
        As the climate changes, farmers face more extreme weather. Seed diversity gives them
        options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drought-tolerant varieties for dry years</li>
        <li>Flood-tolerant varieties for heavy rains</li>
        <li>Heat-tolerant varieties for rising temperatures</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Cultural and nutritional value</h2>
      <p>
        Many traditional varieties are linked to festivals, recipes and local history.
        Losing these seeds can also mean losing cultural identity. Nutritionally, diverse
        diets with different crops are usually healthier than diets based on only a few foods.
