  <h1 class="page-title">🌍 Why does seed diversity matter?</h1>
  <p class="page-subtitle">
    Seed diversity supports food security, climate resilience and cultural identity.
    Losing it makes our food system weaker and less fair.
  </p>

  <div class="info-callout">
    <strong>Big picture:</strong>
    <p>
      When farmers and communities keep many seed varieties alive, they are also
      protecting future options. This gives the next generation more choices than we had,
      not fewer.
    </p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Stable food supply</h3>
        <p>
          If farmers only grow a few modern varieties, a single disease or climate shock
          can damage large areas. A mix of crops and varieties reduces the risk of total
          crop failure.

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Diverse diets</h3>
        <p>
          Traditional grains, pulses, fruits and vegetables often contain more fibre,
          vitamins and minerals than highly processed foods. Seed diversity makes
          it easier for families to eat balanced, healthy meals.

    <div class="grid-2">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Adapting to change</h3>
        <p>
          Some varieties tolerate heat, others survive floods, salinity or drought.
          When farmers have access to many varieties, they can select the ones that
          match their local climate conditions.

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Soil and ecosystem health</h3>
        <p>
          Mixed cropping, rotations with pulses and the use of traditional varieties
          help protect soil structure, support pollinators and reduce the need for
          chemical inputs.

    <h2>🎭 Culture, history and identity</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Seeds are part of culture. Many festivals, recipes and stories are linked to
        specific local varieties. When a seed disappears, a piece of local memory and
        identity disappears with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Farmers, especially Indigenous communities and smallholders, have played a key
        role in creating and saving this diversity over thousands of years.

        Even though seed diversity is so important, it is under pressure from many
        directions. The next page on <strong>Threats</strong> explains what is
        happening, and the <strong>Actions</strong> page suggests what schools and
        communities can do to protect this diversity.
