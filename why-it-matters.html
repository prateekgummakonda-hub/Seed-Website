  <h1 class="page-title">Why Seed Diversity Matters</h1>
  <p class="page-subtitle">
    Seed diversity is not just about plants. It is about climate resilience, food
    security, culture and future innovation.
  </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Climate resilience</h2>
    <div class="grid-2">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Different stress tolerances</h3>
        <p>
          Some varieties tolerate drought, others handle floods or salinity.
          Having many options allows farmers to choose seeds that match changing
          local conditions.

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Adapting to change</h3>
        <p>
          When weather becomes extreme, diverse seeds increase the chance that at
          least some crops survive. This protects harvests and communities.

    <h2>Nutrition and culture</h2>
    <div class="grid-2">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Healthy diets</h3>
        <p>
          Different crops and varieties provide different vitamins, minerals and fibre.
          Losing seed diversity can reduce the nutritional quality of our diets.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Traditional foods</h3>
        <p>
          Many festivals and recipes are linked to specific local varieties. When
          those seeds disappear, part of the culture disappears too.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Future innovation</h2>
    <p>
      Plant breeders and scientists depend on genetic diversity to develop new
      climate-smart and disease-resistant crops. Seed diversity today becomes the
      toolbox for future solutions.
