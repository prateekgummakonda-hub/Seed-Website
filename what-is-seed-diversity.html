    <p class="page-subtitle">
      Seed diversity means having many different varieties of plants, even inside one crop species.

      <h2>Genetic diversity inside crops</h2>
      <p>
        For crops such as rice, wheat, maize, beans or tomatoes, there are many different
        varieties. Each variety has its own combination of genes. These genes control traits
        such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant height and leaf shape</li>
        <li>Seed size, colour and taste</li>
        <li>How fast the plant grows and when it flowers</li>
        <li>Resistance to pests, diseases, heat, cold or drought</li>
      </ul>

          <h3>Rice</h3>
          <p>
            There are thousands of rice varieties. Some grow in deep water, some in dry fields,
            and some tolerate salty soil. This makes rice farming possible in many environments.

          <h3>Beans</h3>
          <p>
            Beans come in many colours and shapes: spotted, striped, black, red and more.
            Each type has different nutrients and grows best in different climates.

          <h3>Tomatoes</h3>
          <p>
            Tomatoes can be small like cherries or big and ribbed. They can be yellow,
            orange, green, purple or red. These differences are also part of seed diversity.

      <h2>Why this definition matters in science</h2>
      <p>
        When we talk about biodiversity, we usually think about different species. Seed diversity
        focuses on diversity within one species. It is especially important in:

        <li>Agriculture and food security</li>
        <li>Conservation biology</li>
        <li>Plant breeding and genetics</li>
