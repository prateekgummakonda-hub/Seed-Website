  <h1 class="page-title">🌱 What is seed diversity?</h1>
  <p class="page-subtitle">
    Seed diversity is the range of different crops and crop varieties that exist on farms,
    in seed banks and in the wild. It is the “hidden library” inside our food system.
  </p>

  <div class="info-callout">
    <strong>Key idea:</strong>
    <p>
      Seed diversity is not only about how many different crops we grow.
      It also includes how many varieties exist within each crop
      (for example many types of rice, millets or pulses).
    </p>
  </div>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>🧬 Genetic diversity inside crops</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Every seed contains genes that control traits such as size, colour, taste,
        growth time and resistance to pests or drought. When we have many varieties
        of a crop, we also have many combinations of these genes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This genetic diversity gives farmers more options. If the climate changes
        or a new disease appears, there is a higher chance that at least some
        varieties will survive.

    <div class="grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>🔹 Between species</h3>
        <p>
          Different crops such as rice, wheat, millets, pulses, vegetables and fruits.
          Growing many species together keeps diets and ecosystems balanced.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>🔹 Within a species</h3>
        <p>
          Many varieties of the same crop. For example red rice, aroma rice and
          drought-tolerant rice are all different varieties of rice.
        </p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>🔹 On the farm</h3>
        <p>
          Diversity in a single field or village. Mixed cropping, home gardens and
          seed sharing networks all increase diversity in real landscapes.

    <h2>🍚 Examples from real crops</h2>
    <div class="grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Rice</h3>
        <p>
          There are thousands of rice varieties with different grain colours, cooking
          qualities and levels of flood or drought tolerance.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Millets</h3>
        <p>
          Finger millet, kodo millet and little millet are examples of hardy crops
          that can grow in poor soils and low rainfall areas.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Pulses</h3>
        <p>
          Black gram, pigeon pea and chickpea provide protein and help fix nitrogen
          in the soil, improving fertility for the next crop.

        why it matters, which threats it faces and what actions we can take
        to protect it.

        example seeds using filters and a compare tool.
